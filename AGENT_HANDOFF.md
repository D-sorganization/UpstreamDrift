# Impact Shaft Provider Integration

Canonical continuation: [docs/development/HANDOFF.md](docs/development/HANDOFF.md).
Development entry: DL-#9912. Branch: feat/9912-impact-provider-pin.
Issue #9912 is a child of #9703/#9701; PR not created. Current commit is SELF.

The existing vendor mechanism now selects Tools 608e85b249e6f61238ac96abbe7dc37428629b9e for review.
Six new contracts fail against the old pin and pass against this candidate.
All 24 provider contracts pass; the candidate is not physically qualified.
Tools #5133 CI repairs, final provider revision and protected review remain.
Do not merge this consumer before the provider is reviewed and green.

## Preserved Repository Context

The previous 516-line root handoff is preserved at the immutable base:
[Full Base Handoff](https://github.com/D-sorganization/UpstreamDrift/blob/6e3610a9b/AGENT_HANDOFF.md).
Its details remain historical evidence, not new completion claims.
Existing capture-product, reference-comparison, instructor, fleet-guide and
Ubuntu CI work belongs to its original owners; preserve those changes.
The canonical handoff retains their incoming text below the current section.

## Standing Constraints

- Read AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md; maintain issue leases and session presence.
- Shared physics belongs in Tools. Do not copy or edit vendored source.
- Use topic branches and normal hooks; preserve protected CI and reviews.
- Manuals/upstreamdrift QMD remains the engineering-manual authority.
- Numerical convergence, measured calibration and perceptual evidence are
  distinct; source hashes alone do not qualify a physical model.
- Refresh this file, canonical handoff and DL-#9912 in implementation commits.
