## 2025-02-23 - F-Order Arrays for Spatial Dynamics
**Learning:** Switching to Fortran-contiguous (column-major) arrays (`order='F'`) for spatial vector collections (like velocity `v` and acceleration `a` with shape `(6, nb)`) enables efficient use of columns as `out` parameters in NumPy operations (like `matmul`). This avoids implicit temporary buffering and copying that occurs when writing to non-contiguous slices of C-ordered arrays, yielding a ~16% speedup in rigid body dynamics loops.

**Action:** When implementing spatial algebra algorithms (RNEA, ABA) where vectors are stored in columns `(6, N)`, initialize arrays with `order='F'` and verify that `out` arguments point to contiguous memory segments.
