          J: API Design, K: Data Handling, L: Logging, M: Configuration, N: Scalability, O: Maintainability

          ## Output
          1. Create docs/assessments/Assessment_X_$DATE.md for each category with grade 0-10

             - Grade table
             - Weighted average (Code 25%, Testing 15%, Docs 10%, Security 15%, Perf 15%, Ops 10%, Design 10%)
             - Top 5 recommendations

          3. For grades below 5: Create GitHub Issue with label 'jules:assessment,needs-attention'
