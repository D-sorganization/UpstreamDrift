  # ARCHIVED / HIDDEN / LEGACY entries preserved below (commented or type: hidden if supported)
  # For now we just don't list them in the Launcher `default_ids` but keeping them structured here
  # actually removes them from the registry if I remove them.
  # Refactoring to only show the 8 above means removing others from this list unless
  # the launcher supports a "More" view.
  # The user request is "Simplify... Two rows of 4 tiles".
  # I will designate ONLY the above 8 for now.
  # The sub-models (simscape_2d, etc) will be accessed via the unified launchers.
