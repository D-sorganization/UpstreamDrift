# CI Requirements - Core dependencies only (excludes heavy modeling packages)
# This file is used in CI/CD to avoid long installation times
# For local development, use requirements.txt which includes all dependencies
#
# Note: We explicitly list dependencies here rather than using -r requirements.txt
# because pip doesn't support excluding specific packages from inherited requirements.
# This ensures CI only installs lightweight dependencies, excluding heavy modeling
# packages (pin, pin-pink, drake, qpsolvers) that would slow down CI builds.
#
# To maintain consistency: When updating versions in requirements.txt, also update
# them here. Both files use the same version pinning strategy for reproducibility.
