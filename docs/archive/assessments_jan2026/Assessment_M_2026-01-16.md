# Assessment M - 2026-01-16

**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Grade:** 8/10

## Focus
Learning curve, examples, video guides.

## Findings
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Examples**: `examples/` directory contains `01_basic_simulation.py` and `02_parameter_sweeps.py`.
    *   **Guidelines**: `project_design_guidelines.qmd` provides deep theoretical context.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Tutorials**: The `docs/tutorials/` directory was missing (fixed).
    *   **Interactive Content**: No Jupyter notebooks were found for interactive learning.

## Recommendations
1.  **Create Notebooks**: Convert the examples into Jupyter notebooks in `docs/tutorials`.
2.  **Video Guides**: Record short screencasts of common workflows.

## Safe Fixes Applied
*   **Created Tutorials Directory**: Added `docs/tutorials/README.md` to establish the structure for future content.
