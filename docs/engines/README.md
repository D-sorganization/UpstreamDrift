# Physics Engines

The Golf Modeling Suite integrates multiple physics engines to allow for cross-validation and specialized analysis.

## Available Engines

- **[MuJoCo](mujoco.md)**: fast, accurate physics engine suitable for contact-rich environments and reinforcement learning.
- **[Drake](drake.md)**: Focused on stability, model-based design, and rigorous verification.
- **[Pinocchio](pinocchio.md)**: Efficient rigid body dynamics algorithms, excellent for kinematic and dynamic analysis.
- **[Simscape Multibody](simscape.md)**: High-fidelity biomechanical modeling using MATLAB/Simulink.
- **[Pendulum Models](pendulum.md)**: Simplified 2D models for fundamental swing mechanics.
