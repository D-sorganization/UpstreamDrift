## Known Limitations

### MuJoCo

**Strengths**:

- Excellent contact dynamics (soft contacts)
- Fast simulation (optimized C++ core)
- Induced acceleration analysis (best-in-class)
- Conditioning warnings (Jan 2026)

**Limitations**:

- **Counterfactuals**: Not implemented - use Pinocchio for drift-control analysis
- **Screw Kinematics**: Not implemented
- **Contact Model**: Soft contacts only, no hard constraints
- **Integration**: Semi-implicit Euler (default) - can cause small deviations vs Drake/Pinocchio

**Use When**: Need fast simulation, contact dynamics, induced acceleration analysis

### Drake

**Strengths**:

- Excellent numerical stability (Runge-Kutta 3)
- Rich constraint modeling
- Strong optimization integration
- Conditioning warnings (Jan 2026)

**Limitations**:

- **Induced Acceleration**: Not implemented - use MuJoCo
- **Counterfactuals**: Not implemented - use Pinocchio
- **Integration Method**: RK3 causes ~1% differences vs MuJoCo semi-implicit
- **Setup Complexity**: More verbose API than MuJoCo

**Use When**: Need robust optimization, complex constraints, high numerical precision

### Pinocchio

**Strengths**:

- Excellent counterfactual analysis (ZTCF/ZVCF)
- Drift-control decomposition (state-of-the-art)
- Fastest kinematics computation
- Strong URDF support

**Limitations**:

- **Induced Acceleration**: Not implemented - use MuJoCo
- **Conditioning Warnings**: Missing (Jan 2026) - to be added
- **Visualization**: No native viewer - use MuJoCo or Meshcat
- **Contact Dynamics**: Basic compared to MuJoCo

**Use When**: Need counterfactuals, drift-control analysis, trajectory optimization

### Pendulum Models

**Strengths**:

- Analytical ground truth (symbolic derivation)
- Perfect for cross-engine validation
- Zero numerical error (within SymPy precision)

**Limitations**:

- **DOF**: Limited to 1-3 DOF systems (single, double, triple pendulum)
- **Scope**: No complex constraints, contacts, or closed loops
- **Visualization**: Basic matplotlib only

**Use When**: Validating engines, testing numerical methods, benchmarking

### OpenSim / MyoSuite

**Status**: Stub only (Jan 2026)
**Priority**: Long-term (Guideline J/K requirements)
**Estimated Implementation**: 12+ weeks for full integration

## Cross-Engine Comparison Results

### Double Pendulum Benchmark (Jan 2026)

**Test Setup**:

- Model: 2-DOF double pendulum
- Duration: 5 seconds
- Timestep: 0.01 s (500 steps)
- Initial: q₀ = [0.1, 0.2] rad, q̇₀ = [0, 0]

**Results**:

| Engines Compared    | Position Dev | Velocity Dev | Torque RMS | Jacobian Dev | Status  |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| MuJoCo vs Drake     | 3.2e-7 m     | 1.8e-6 m/s   | 5%         | 2.1e-9       | ✅ PASS |
| MuJoCo vs Pinocchio | 4.1e-7 m     | 2.3e-6 m/s   | 6%         | 3.2e-9       | ✅ PASS |
| Drake vs Pinocchio  | 2.8e-7 m     | 1.5e-6 m/s   | 4%         | 1.8e-9       | ✅ PASS |

**Conclusion**: All engines agree within Guideline P3 tolerances ✅

**Caveat**: Manual validation only - automated tests needed (Guideline M2)

## Integration Method Differences

Understanding why engines produce slightly different results:

### MuJoCo (Semi-Implicit Euler)

- **Method**: `qₙ₊₁ = qₙ + dt·q̇ₙ₊₁` (velocity first, then position)
- **Stability**: Excellent for stiff systems
- **Accuracy**: O(dt) first-order
- **Energy**: Small drift (<0.1% for conservative systems)

### Drake (Runge-Kutta 3)

- **Method**: 3rd-order explicit RK
- **Stability**: Very good
- **Accuracy**: O(dt³) third-order
- **Energy**: Better conservation than MuJoCo (~0.01%)

### Pinocchio (User-Specified)

- **Method**: User selects (we use Euler for comparability)
- **Stability**: Depends on integrator
- **Accuracy**: Depends on integrator
- **Energy**: Depends on integrator

**Expected Deviations**: Integration method differences cause ~0.1-1% variations in transient response. This is normal and within tolerance.
