# Pinocchio Engine

## Overview
Pinocchio is a library for fast rigid body dynamics algorithms based on the Featherstone arithmetic. It is particularly efficient for computing kinematics and dynamics derivatives.

## Key Features in Suite
- Extremely fast recursive algorithms (RNEA, ABA, CRBA).
- Python bindings for rapid prototyping.
- Integration with other robotics tools.

## Usage
