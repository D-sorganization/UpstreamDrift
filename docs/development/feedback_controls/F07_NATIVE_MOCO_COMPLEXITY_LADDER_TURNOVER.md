# F07 Native Moco Complexity Ladder Turnover

## Bounded Run at Frozen Harness `856803317e0ccb26bd4ba43348244ac735c01f15`

One serial run was authorized with a 30-second ceiling per rung, a sampled
1 GiB process-tree RSS stop threshold, and stop-on-first-nonpass. The verified
supervisor was Python 3.13; the isolated worker used the repository's dedicated
OpenSim 4.6 SDK interpreter. The supervisor stopped after the first `plain`
rung. It did not start an optimizer or launch any later rung.

The worker failed after 2.974 seconds while flushing the staged `source.osim`:
`os.fsync()` received a read-only Windows file descriptor and raised
`OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor`. The supervisor observed a sampled
peak process-tree RSS of 184,315,904 bytes (about 176 MiB), then completed its
owned process-tree cleanup. This was a harness staging failure; it provides no
solve, export, replay, feasibility, or physiological evidence.

Review also found that the planned moving-path-point spline samples
`[-0.01, 0, 0.01]` at knots `[-1, 0, 1]` were collinear, so they did not
represent a nonlinear moving guide. The first run stopped before that rung and
does not validate it. A follow-up changes the monotone bounded sample law to
`[-0.008, 0, 0.012]`, checks nonzero curvature from the native-loaded path
point at two coordinate neighborhoods, and confirms that a collinear native
source is rejected. It also flushes the staged model through a writable file
descriptor. These corrections require a fresh frozen revision and a separate
explicit run authorization; this turnover does not authorize another solve.

The ladder remains a synthetic software feasibility diagnostic. Even a future
successful solve and fresh replay would not qualify muscle physiology, the
captured swing, independent excitation parity, or production readiness.
