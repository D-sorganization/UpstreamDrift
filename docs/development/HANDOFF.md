## Objective and Status

- Objective: build agent-editable `GS3DX_` clones of `GolfSwing3D_Kinetic.slx` in
  `src/engines/Simscape_Multibody_Models/3D_Golf_Model/matlab/exploratory_gs3dx/`,
  move shoulders and hip to quaternion joints, and grow to a full-body model under
  the 1,000 non-virtual-block Home-license limit, without touching the originals.
- Status: GS3DX-1 (#10951) scaffold, GS3DX-2 (#10952) regression harness, GS3DX-3
  (#10953) block budget, GS3DX-4 (#10954) `GS3DX_Slim`, GS3DX-5 (#10955) `GS3DX_Quat`
  quaternion shoulders and GS3DX-6 (#10956) quaternion hip done.
- Completed:
  1. `gs3dx_setup` (session path, cache redirect, no `savepath`), `gs3dx_names`,
     `gs3dx_assert_no_shadowing`, `gs3dx_save_model` (write guard),
     `gs3dx_original_manifest`, `gs3dx_clone_baseline`.
  2. `models/GS3DX_Baseline.slx` + `GS3DX_KD_{Gimbal,Revolute,Universal}.slx` generated
     headlessly in R2025b; 12 `ReferencedSubsystem` blocks re-pointed.
  3. `tests/test_gs3dx_safety.m` 5/5 pass.
  4. #10952: `gs3dx_simulate`, `gs3dx_flatten_bus` (1 kHz grid), `gs3dx_compare`
     (`max_abs <= atol + rtol*range`, atol 1e-6, rtol 1e-3) and
     `gs3dx_capture_original_baseline`. Baselines per drive (`gs3dx_drive`,
     `gs3dx_baseline_file`): `original_GolfSwing3D_Kinetic_impact_0p3S.mat` (regression
     drive, 344 steps) and `..._persisted_0p3S.mat` (model's saved inputs, 4,236 steps).
     GS3DX_Baseline matches both on all 413 signals with identical step counts.
  5. #10953 (agy draft, reviewed and corrected): `gs3dx_block_budget`,
     `gs3dx_license_limit_probe`, `docs/BLOCK_BUDGET_FINDINGS.md`. Limit verified exactly:
     1,000 non-virtual blocks simulate, 1,001 fail at compile.
  6. #10954: `gs3dx_build_slim` copies Baseline/KD to `GS3DX_Slim`/`GS3DX_KDS_*` and
     `gs3dx_direct_torque_drive` rewires each torque axis converter -> joint InputTorque
     (drops Ideal Torque Source, Rotational Multibody Interface, Reference). 672 -> 609
     non-virtual blocks (63 saved). Slim matches the original on the impact drive
     (413/413 signals, 344 steps, clubhead max diff 6e-14 m).
  7. Found the persisted drive is ill-conditioned (clubhead > 4 km/s by 0.3 s; a 1e-9
     RelTol change moves the clubhead 2.4 m), so it cannot prove any restructuring;
     the impact drive is the regression drive. `docs/SENSITIVITY_FINDINGS.md`.
  8. #10955: `gs3dx_build_quat` copies Slim/KDS_Gimbal to `GS3DX_Quat`/`GS3DX_KDS_Spherical`;
     `gs3dx_gimbal_to_spherical` swaps the Gimbal Joint for a Spherical Joint keeping the
     subsystem interface (ports, mask, 21 bus elements) via `gs3dx_xyz_map` (Euler X-Y-Z <->
     quaternion; `XYZ Torque` and `XYZ Kinematics` MATLAB Function blocks, `Angle Reference`
     integrator for the 360-degree branch). 609 -> 599 blocks. Isolated rig
     (`gs3dx_joint_rig`): all 21 signals match the Gimbal to <= 2e-7 of peak at RelTol 1e-8.
     Full model: the Low-priority right shoulder assembles differently in a closed chain, so
     `gs3dx_pinned_drive` pins its start state; then Quat converges to Slim as RelTol tightens
     (clubhead gap 13.9 mm / 0.54 mm / 0.039 mm at 1e-3/1e-5/1e-7), is closer than Slim to the
     converged answer at every tolerance, and takes 7-9% fewer steps.
     `docs/QUATERNION_SHOULDERS.md`.
  9. Refactors: `gs3dx_physical_graph` + `gs3dx_redraw_nets` (shared net surgery),
     `gs3dx_copy_models` (copy guard), `gs3dx_simulate` `block_parameters` option,
     `gs3dx_repoint_references` skips subsystem-reference internals.
  10. #10956: `gs3dx_quaternion_swap` is the shared swap core (port map per joint type);
      `gs3dx_gimbal_to_spherical` and `gs3dx_bushing_to_6dof` are thin specs over it.
      The hip Bushing Joint becomes a 6-DOF Joint (prismatics copied, rotation quaternion);
      `GS3DX_Quat` is 594 blocks (15 below Slim). `gs3dx_hip_rig` (+ `gs3dx_rig_scaffold`,
      `gs3dx_rig_simulate`, shared with the refactored joint rig): all 30 HipLogs signals match
      the Bushing to <= 1.9e-6 of peak. Convergence with the hip: 14.8 / 0.61 mm at 1e-3 / 1e-5.

## Files and Decisions

- The originals are only `copyfile`d, never loaded or saved, so R2025b cannot re-save them
  (the original .slx was last saved in R2025a).
- The exploratory folder sits outside `matlab/src/`, so `setup_matlab_environment`'s
  `genpath(src)` never adds it to the path.
- Shadowing risk is real: during the probe, a same-named scratch copy won `which()`.
- The baseline is stored in double precision: float32 rounding alone (1.9e-6 on the
  constant GolferMass) exceeded atol; the tolerance was not widened.
- The model needs `matlab/src/functions` on the path (`HexPolyInputFunction`), so
  `gs3dx_setup` adds it as `dependency_dirs`.
- Per-joint cost: KD Gimbal 37 non-virtual blocks (21 converters), Universal 29 (17),
  Revolute 21 (13). Each torque axis uses Simulink-PS -> Ideal Torque Source ->
  Rotational Multibody Interface + Reference (4 blocks) although the joint axis is
  already `InputTorque`; a direct PS torque input saves 3 blocks per axis (63 total).
- Simulink physical lines: a branched net lists its segments only on the trunk
  (`LineChildren`, which includes the trunk itself); branch segments report no parent or
  end ports. `gs3dx_direct_torque_drive` finds nets by union-find over all segments.
- Count blocks on a freshly loaded model: after a simulation in the same session
  `find_system` counts differ (+101 on Slim).
- The KDS Bus Creator is named `Bus
Creator` (newline); find it by BlockType.
- A MATLAB Function block is direct feedthrough, and the sensed acceleration depends on the
  torque, so torque and kinematics mapping are two blocks (one would form an algebraic loop).
  The damping Constant needs SampleTime 0: constant-time blocks may not touch the shoulder
  input-function loop.
- A Spherical Joint has one target per quantity: the mask init asserts equal Rx/Ry/Rz
  priorities, so set all six priorities in one `set_param` call.
- Impact-input mode sweep: mode 3 ill-conditioned, mode 2 torqued but 1e8 N\*m, mode 1 fails
  early. Not gimbal lock: Quat (quaternion hip) fails at 19.9 ms with hip Y at 49° while the
  mode-1 hip torque command reaches ~2e7 N\*m. The drive blows up, not the joint.
- `gs3dx_physical_graph` on a subsystem: `find_system` lists the subsystem itself; exclude it.
- Rig constant signals are logged once; `gs3dx_rig_simulate` expands them to the output grid.
- The hip rig's default torques keep the Bushing's Y angle within -72..62°; 6x larger
  torques reach 84° (near singular, 1.8e4 deg/s).

## Validation

- From an empty cwd: `matlab.exe -batch "addpath('<exploratory_gs3dx>'); info=gs3dx_setup(); runtests(fullfile(info.root,'tests'))"`
  → 49 passed, 0 failed, 481 s (2026-09-26; the Simulation-tagged tests take most of the time;
  select `~HasTag('Simulation')` for the structural tests).
- The original model simulates headlessly (0.3 s of swing takes about 223 s cold); the model workspace is embedded (676 vars).

## Blockers and Risks

- MATLAB tests need a licensed R2025b; they are not part of the Python CI.

## Next Steps

1. #10957 lower body: design pelvis/legs (hips, knees, ankles) on `GS3DX_Quat` with
   quaternion hips/ankles from `gs3dx_quaternion_swap`, <= 900 non-virtual blocks.
2. #10958 feet/ground and full-body integration; #10959 Sonnet visual QA.
