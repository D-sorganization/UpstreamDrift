# Native Multi-Engine Matching Handoff

## Current Status

The full matching goal is OPEN. Robust trajectory equivalence of the alternate
representation is not yet qualified. No accepted full-swing open-loop sixth-order
candidate exists. MATLAB R2025b is the required reference release. Keep the
original capture, physical model, initial state, actuator mapping and acceptance
criteria; quaternion conversion does not change the required native torque family.

Branch: feat/9967-native-simscape-pinocchio. Checkpoint9a136cef7 is pushed with
all normal hooks passing. SELF adds terminal63/64 evidence and tested optional
forward/sensitivity evaluation budgets. PR not created. Issue #9967 owns native matching; #10043 owns representation work,
under #9921. Check/renew the lease before new issue work. Workspace:
C:/Users/diete/Repositories/Worktrees/UpstreamDrift-pinocchio-native.

Latest cleanly returned exploratory fit: run62,0.85 s only, whole RMS28.635 mm
and terminal66.713 mm. It is rejected, not a full-swing match. See
[Candidate](simscape_tour_matching/native_evidence/regularized_fit_9967_62/returned-candidate.json)
and [Measured Comparison](simscape_tour_matching/native_evidence/regularized_fit_9967_62/marker-comparison.png).

## Representation Qualification

Run58 is terminal (handle2605 exited0). Local-chart DOP853 on native spherical
Pinocchio PASSES all existing parity gates over the run19 0.85-second fixture:
marker maximum2.62982e-8 m; native q maximum1.28599e-7; native rate
maximum1.15849e-5; closure pose3.74372e-11 and rate9.40426e-11.
Elapsed37.6895 s/9972 RHS calls versus7.2147 s for the tighter scalar reference.
This is a same-input representation result, NOT a C3D fit or full R2025b parity.

Run59 is TERMINAL, original handle97788 exited0: same setup with smaller maximum
step. It FAILS native velocity parity (0.000587270); marker maximum1.15187e-7 m,
native q6.06676e-7, closure pose6.60249e-11/rate1.61521e-10. Elapsed61.2725 s.
Therefore58's isolated pass is not robust convergence or representation acceptance.
Those representation runs are terminal. The pointwise acceleration/history audit
found no sampled history dependence or substantial actuator-route mismatch:
maximum routed native acceleration difference2.18034e-6 rad/s² at a reference
539073.49 rad/s²; effort roundtrip1.25056e-12. Sampled unscaled inertia condition
is about6.7e7 in both representations. These results support investigating
conditioning/trajectory sensitivity, not declaring a physical-model mismatch.
They do not establish global convergence. Detailed receipt:

launching another run. All root runs through59 are terminal; none should restart.

## Transition Sensitivity and Regularized Fitting

Run60 completes six original-state replays. Repeated baseline results are exactly
identical. A late LSInputX B6 perturbation of1e-6 Nm changes native rates by
0.00750466 rad/s near0.786111 s but markers by only0.5386 micrometres. The
1e-4 Nm trials produce about0.765 rad/s and50.8 micrometres. Central derivative
estimates retain amplitude dependence; these are measured sensitivity evidence,
not a waiver of parity gates. Exact inputs, executed source and raw trajectories
are archived in native_evidence/perturbation_9967_60.

Shared prefix and multiple-shooting fitters now accept checked analytic penalty
Jacobians. NativeEffortPenalty reuses the native actuator/frame provider and
seven-point quadrature to evaluate exact mean-square total degree-six primitive
efforts. Twelve new tests passed after RED; combined fitter/effort/control regression77 tests
passes, as do Ruff and four-module mypy. Immutable ControlTower runtime61 passes
96 focused/real Pinocchio tests; source archives/hashes are preserved in
native_evidence/regularized_fit_runtime_9967_61. Existing runner behavior remains
the default with zero penalty. Trial61 is terminal0 in75.40 s: whole RMS29.813 mm, early10.707 mm,
terminal75.846 mm, club23.930 mm, versus baseline30.791/10.667/99.989/56.557 mm.
All three primal sensitivity gates pass. Max_nfev3 was reached; no numerical
acceptance or convergence is claimed. Native effort cost barely changes
(1.55060 to1.55026), so improvement cannot be attributed to the penalty alone.
Exact evidence and convenient candidate: native_evidence/regularized_fit_9967_61.

Run62 is terminal0 after468.965 s: whole28.6353 mm, early10.8248 mm,
terminal66.7134 mm, club31.0615 mm. It reaches max_nfev20 with four active
correction bounds; accepted/converged both false. Returned canonical candidate

Native evidence folder regularized_fit_9967_62 contains the terminal receipt,
measured replay arrays and marker-comparison.png (root visually inspected).
Run63 is terminal1 after77.672 s and three forward evaluations. The B4/B5/B6
trial fails the unchanged sensitivity-primal marker agreement gate on its third
candidate, hash e057a7e977cfe2a163fe4c5e7e5767c17d5025b4ef7f33166672afbf658c358d.
There is no returned accepted candidate. First two Jacobians passed. Diagnostic64
PASSES at that exact candidate before its600 s wall budget: augmented solve
409.086 s/1,222,535 evaluations, primal marker discrepancy8.9147861e-9 m against
the unchanged1e-7 gate. Total launch466.239 s; diagnostic call/save419.190 s.
The augmented settings were rtol1e-12/atol1e-14/max_step0.000125. The provider's
independent primal remained rtol1e-11/atol1e-13; max_step applies to both. This
supports an accuracy-dependent63 failure, not a derivative correctness or C3D
acceptance claim. Cost is far above the default sensitivity calls. All jobs
through64 are terminal; no optimizer or diagnostic remains active.
Runtime61 remains immutable; the local list annotation changes typing only.

The shared native motion sequence API is implemented and publicly exported.
It converts complete batches with immutable time/model/frame/branch metadata
and original per-sample references, reusing NativeJointStateAdapter. Root passes
89 related tests. File I/O, UI and complete dynamic frame transport are next;
this batch API does not qualify alternate MuJoCo/Drake dynamics. See dedicated
REPRESENTATION_HANDOFF for runnable usage and the remaining ordered plan.

## Reproducible Compute Limits

`integrate_forward` and `integrate_sensitivities` now accept optional positive
integer max_evaluations, checked before excess derivative/linearization calls.
`replay_marker_sensitivities` exposes max_sensitivity_evaluations for the augmented
solve only; its independent primal replay remains separate. DefaultsNone retain
existing behavior. Seven new tests and native forwarding checks went RED/GREEN;
27 related tests, Ruff and pinned mypy pass. This source update is NOT in immutable
runtime61; qualify a new runtime before using it remotely. Budgets are not a
numerical accuracy or wall-time guarantee. Exhaustion raises without partial data.

## Why Earlier Attempts Stalled

- Static pose fitting and feedback tracking did not produce an open-loop sextic
  motion. Run45 feedback whole RMS35.2 mm becomes346.5 mm in time-only replay,
  and655.5 mm after global-sixth-order compression. Do not promote the initializer.
- An actual native gimbal singularity stopped run41. An independent inverse-angle
  branch bug caused run49 to apply a different native effort map. Branch metadata
  is now explicit and tested; true singular native actuator inverses remain rejected.
- Native rate errors are amplified near the shoulder chart. Run52 physical
  angular error0.000208 rad/s became native rate error0.00465 rad/s. Tight scalar
  reference54 and manifold tolerance refinement led to passed58. Gates were not
  relaxed. Run54/55 second-level budgets were insufficient even for their selected
  maximum step; those failures are not proof of solver nonconvergence.
- The Python manifold implementation remains slower than scalar Pinocchio. Keep
  scalar native dynamics available as the fitting baseline while qualifying
  alternate representations. Do not block fitting on all-engine alternate builders.

## Ordered Next Work

1. Qualify a new runtime containing the tested call-budget API, then run one
   fixed-candidate comparison at63's failing hash using original augmented
   tolerances1e-10/1e-12, max_step0.000125 and a100000 sensitivity-call budget.
   This isolates smaller step from64's expensive tolerance change. Keep both
   numerical gates. If it cannot pass cheaply, stop optimizer retries and add
   a manufactured physical-state accuracy test with added zero sensitivity
   columns before changing adaptive error control. Current DOP853 uses one
   error norm over54 states plus54\*81 sensitivities; adding parameters changes
   the norm. Qualify blockwise control or a separate variational solve along
   an accurate continuous primal trajectory, including directional derivatives.
   Do not infer analytic Jacobian correctness merely from primal agreement.

2. Qualify the variant over further representative trajectories and against
   MATLAB R2025b before claiming full equivalence. Qualify tangent derivatives
   before using the manifold variant in an optimizer. Preserve existing scalar API.
3. Resume trajectory/control co-optimization using native constrained forward
   dynamics. Reuse native profile, sensitivity, marker and shooting providers.
   Start from integrated states, permit trajectory changes, and optimize a global
   degree-six native effort basis. Do not repeat tight static-node boxes or simply
   compress an arbitrary feedback torque trace. Existing seven-DOF bioptim tracking
   is a different physical model and cannot silently replace this native model.
4. Require uninterrupted original-state replay through1.813888889 s, all654 capture
   frames and valid observations, closure, effort audit and independent R2025b
   validation before accepting the final swing. Preserve per-marker/time residuals,
   overlay animation, coefficient/time-basis metadata and exact input hashes.
5. Implement/qualify remaining engine variants sequentially using canonical
   pose_interchange providers, without inferring dynamics parity from pose roundtrips.

## Engine and Representation Handoffs

- [Pinocchio Manifold](simscape_tour_matching/PINOCCHIO_MANIFOLD_HANDOFF.md): native
  spherical variant nq30/nv27, exact fixed transforms/inertia/weld reused. DOP853
  integrates local tangent coordinates and carries physical endpoints unchanged;
  no quaternion projection or target-state reset. Runtime18 passes96 tests with
  one optional MuJoCo skip; root independently verified generic and real Pin tests.
  Remote receipts qualify the numerical runtime bundle, not full GUI/application
  deployment; retain the documented package boundaries when reproducing.
- [Canonical Representations](simscape_tour_matching/REPRESENTATION_HANDOFF.md):
  angle/quaternion/rate/convective-acceleration/effort conversions and fixed-frame
  transport. Preserve units, named frames, branch/winding and model identity.
  Moving-frame acceleration transport and #8867 convention consolidation remain open.
- [MuJoCo](mujoco_native_matching/HANDOFF.md) and
  [Drake](drake_native_matching/HANDOFF.md): native adapters and narrower receipts
  exist; alternate quaternion builders/full trajectory equivalence remain open.
  Drake's projected accelerations are not derivative-consistent trajectories.
- OpenSim epic #10003: plan/handoff branch docs/10003-opensim-matching-epic,
  documented plan commit1a68091b6. Implementation/runtime qualification is not
  accepted. Inspect its branch and requested planning check-in before proceeding.

The documented development-log validator path is absent in this checkout; no
validator pass is claimed. Normal configured commit/push hooks still apply.
