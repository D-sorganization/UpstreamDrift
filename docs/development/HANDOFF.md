## Objective and Status

- Objective: build agent-editable `GS3DX_` clones of `GolfSwing3D_Kinetic.slx` in
  `src/engines/Simscape_Multibody_Models/3D_Golf_Model/matlab/exploratory_gs3dx/`,
  move shoulders and hip to quaternion joints, and grow to a full-body model under
  the 1,000 non-virtual-block Home-license limit, without touching the originals.
- Status: GS3DX-1 (#10951) scaffold, GS3DX-2 (#10952) regression harness and GS3DX-3
  (#10953) block budget done.
- Completed:
  1. `gs3dx_setup` (session path, cache redirect, no `savepath`), `gs3dx_names`,
     `gs3dx_assert_no_shadowing`, `gs3dx_save_model` (write guard),
     `gs3dx_original_manifest`, `gs3dx_clone_baseline`.
  2. `models/GS3DX_Baseline.slx` + `GS3DX_KD_{Gimbal,Revolute,Universal}.slx` generated
     headlessly in R2025b; 12 `ReferencedSubsystem` blocks re-pointed.
  3. `tests/test_gs3dx_safety.m` 5/5 pass.
  4. #10952: `gs3dx_simulate`, `gs3dx_flatten_bus` (1 kHz grid), `gs3dx_compare`
     (`max_abs <= atol + rtol*range`, atol 1e-6, rtol 1e-3) and
     `gs3dx_capture_original_baseline`; `baselines/original_GolfSwing3D_Kinetic_0p3S.mat`
     (double precision, 413 signals, 4,236 steps). GS3DX_Baseline matches it on all 413
     signals with an identical step count.
  5. #10953 (agy draft, reviewed and corrected): `gs3dx_block_budget`,
     `gs3dx_license_limit_probe`, `docs/BLOCK_BUDGET_FINDINGS.md`. Limit verified exactly:
     1,000 non-virtual blocks simulate, 1,001 fail at compile.

## Files and Decisions

- The originals are only `copyfile`d, never loaded or saved, so R2025b cannot re-save them
  (the original .slx was last saved in R2025a).
- The exploratory folder sits outside `matlab/src/`, so `setup_matlab_environment`'s
  `genpath(src)` never adds it to the path.
- Shadowing risk is real: during the probe, a same-named scratch copy won `which()`.
- The baseline is stored in double precision: float32 rounding alone (1.9e-6 on the
  constant GolferMass) exceeded atol; the tolerance was not widened.
- The model needs `matlab/src/functions` on the path (`HexPolyInputFunction`), so
  `gs3dx_setup` adds it as `dependency_dirs`.
- Per-joint cost: KD Gimbal 37 non-virtual blocks (21 converters), Universal 29 (17),
  Revolute 21 (13). Each torque axis uses Simulink-PS -> Ideal Torque Source ->
  Rotational Multibody Interface + Reference (4 blocks) although the joint axis is
  already `InputTorque`; a direct PS torque input saves 3 blocks per axis (63 total).

## Validation

- From an empty cwd: `matlab.exe -batch "addpath('<exploratory_gs3dx>'); info=gs3dx_setup(); runtests(fullfile(info.root,'tests'))"`
  → 21 passed, 0 failed (clone equivalence test ~150 s; exclude with `'ExcludeTag','Simulation'`).
- The original model simulates headlessly (0.3 s of swing takes about 223 s cold); the model workspace is embedded (676 vars).

## Blockers and Risks

- MATLAB tests need a licensed R2025b; they are not part of the Python CI.

## Next Steps

1. Push and open a draft PR; remove agy worktree `../agy-gs3dx-10953`.
2. #10954 `GS3DX_Slim`: direct `InputTorque` drive (drop Ideal Torque Source, Interface,
   Reference per axis), collapse World Frames; must pass the harness.
3. #10955/#10956 quaternion shoulders and hip, then #10957/#10958 lower body.
