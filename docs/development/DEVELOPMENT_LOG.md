- **Summary:** Pin `vendor/ud-tools` to Tools 1ac89c18e, replace the rig's own ffmpeg preview decode with one adapter over Tools `shared.python.camera.FfmpegDirectShowSource` (seam points rig → Tools), delegate `dshow_device_ref` to the shared builder, and pin the launched command token-for-token against the pre-port list. The shared package is a `sidekick.lab.mocap` consumer, so it imports at launcher runtime and in the isolated provider harness, not in the root test process.
- **Next step:** Operator verifies on the rig that the preview binds all three cameras at 60 fps and Record still hands off, then merges the PR.

### DL-#10062 · Full-Body Models With Lower Limbs and Ground Contact

- **IK & Forward Dynamics Consolidation (MS-11 #10330; 2026-09-17):**
  Consolidated ground-support marker IK and forward dynamics into shared modules, retiring
  `src/engines/physics_engines/mujoco/python/full_body_markers.py` (813 -> 44 lines) and
  `full_body_simulation.py` (709 -> 55 lines) into backward-compatible deprecation shims
  and eliminating 1,423 duplicate lines across engine files. Shared solver and dataclasses live
  in `src/shared/python/motion_matching/full_body_ik.py` (`BaseFullBodyIK`) and
  `src/shared/python/motion_matching/full_body_forward_dynamics.py` with zero MuJoCo imports in
  shared motion matching. MuJoCo adapter preserved as subclass in
  `src/engines/physics_engines/mujoco/python/full_body_ik.py`. Added comprehensive consolidation
  test suite `tests/unit/motion_matching/test_full_body_consolidation.py`.

- **Pink Displaced Targets & Both-Club Smoke Qualification (2026-09-17):**
  Added tests verifying that reachable displaced marker targets produce nonzero motion
  and measurable residual reduction, infeasible hard constraints fail qualification closed
  with structured failure reasons, and both driver and 7-iron smoke journeys produce valid
  conforming receipts through `MatchRequest` and `ConstrainedIkReceipt`.

- **Pink Integration Defect Repair & Fail-Closed Qualification (#10318; 2026-09-17):**
  Repaired three blocking defects in the Pink constrained IK pipeline:

  1. Driver interface: Replaced nonexistent module reference in `run_ground_support.py`
     with `PinkTrajectoryService`, `IKTrajectoryRequest`, and `IKOptions`, generating
     conforming `ConstrainedIkReceipt` records.
  2. Fail-closed native execution: Eliminated silent no-op fallback in
     `PinkTrajectoryService._execute_qp_step`; missing native stack or model fails closed
     with explicit failure reasons.
  3. Honest constraint evaluation: Enforced `NaN` residuals for unevaluated marker and
     weld constraints, and gated qualification on rate limit violations and named
     physical tolerances (`weld_translation_tolerance_m`, `weld_rotation_tolerance_rad`,
     `marker_tolerance_m`).

- **Pink Pipeline & Receipt Exposure (#10278; 2026-09-17):** Exposed Pink
  constrained inverse kinematics backend through `MatchRequest` (`backend="pink"`,
  `step_mode`, `solver`), CLI `--backend pink`, and GUI dropdown. Structured
  diagnostics and provenance recorded via `ConstrainedIkReceipt` in receipt schema.
  Fail-closed capability probe `probe_pink_capability()` prevents silent fallback.
  Regenerated `RECEIPTS.md`.

- **Viewer Adapters (#10256; 2026-09-16):** Replaced no-op display paths with
  persistent Pinocchio visualizers, explicit validation and scoped cleanup.
  Real MeshCat probing exposed and corrected shared-root deletion and owned
  process cleanup defects. Live Gepetto qualification and production replay
  integration remain outstanding under #10254.

- **Runtime Qualification (#10262; 2026-09-16):** Runtime slice #10262 adds a consistent conda-forge numerical manifest and exact
  Linux lock plus isolated capability probes. Receipt success is scoped to
  runtime behavior; model, full-body fitting and renderer acceptance stay open.

- **Pink Adapters (#10257; 2026-09-16):** Shared solve path validates state,
  time and outputs; forwards hard constraints/limits; retains collision
  geometry; refreshes cached FK and propagates solver failures. Real native
  contracts include free-flyer dimensions and infeasible equality/limit
  combinations. Full-body task assembly and runtime packaging (#10262) remain
  separate; no fitted trajectories were regenerated.

- **LoD Regression (#10254; 2026-09-16):** Reproduced the main-derived
  `inputs.calibration2.offsets.items()` architecture failure before the change.
  Resolve the owned offset mapping once before formatting the report; preserve
  explicit/calibrated/attachment precedence. Seven reference-stage tests and
  the full 3,221-file LoD no-growth scan pass; the baseline was not changed.

- **Integration Turnover (#10254; 2026-09-16):** Post-compaction Crocoddyl ABI
  and Pink feasible/infeasible QP probes pass on the preserved WSL environment.
  Added bounded TDD/DbC/LoD/DRY worker contracts and three Pink pipeline packets.
  Main authority is 0ec64e45; #10250/#10251 are closed. Native action assembly,
  production Pink integration, CI and full physical qualification remain open.
  See `docs/plans/qualified_motion_integration/TURNOVER.md`.

Slice #10265 preserves global degree-six controls with a checked unactuated
root mapping and exact RK4 state/coefficient sensitivities. It is a prerequisite
to coefficient-lift Crocoddyl actions; optimizer and physical acceptance remain
open. Preserve explicit ground configuration in independent replay.

- **Crocoddyl Actions (#10269; 2026-09-16):** Implemented the lift/flow/terminal
  models, exact RK4 chain-rule derivatives, cost scaling, coefficient bounds, warm starts
  and independent replay diagnostics. Cases tested in isolation include real FDDP, BoxFDDP
  bounded polynomial effort and full-body active/offground contact with canonical/reversed
  coordinates.

- **Weld Linearization (#10260; 2026-09-16):** Corrected the finite weld pose
  Jacobian and preserved the distinct acceleration-constraint partial. Real
  Pinocchio directional checks fail before correction for displaced wrists;
  all 11 closure and 11 contact integration tests pass afterward, including
  explicit rejection of undefined derivatives at the rotation-pi log branch. Next:
  merge numerical prerequisites before constrained Pink task assembly.

- **Solver Integration (#10254, #10255; 2026-09-16):** Reproduced missing
  ground-contact state terms in inherited Pinocchio acceleration derivatives;
  added exact local contact-force partials and constrained chain-rule composition.
  Real Pinocchio 3.8 integration tests cover active/no contact, moving joints,
  reversed coordinate order, nonfinite input, contact kinks and cache isolation.
  Plan: `docs/plans/qualified_motion_integration/README.md`. Next: review/merge
  derivative boundary, then integrate #10257 Pink and #10256 viewer adapters;
  preserve #10250 evidence refresh and all full-horizon qualification gates.

- **Issue:** #8360 (related #8339, #8358, #8359)
- **PR:** #9951 (merged)
- **Paths:** src/launchers/startup.py, src/launchers/startup_phases.py, src/launchers/startup_session.py, src/launchers/startup_failure_dialog.py, src/launchers/upstream_drift_launcher_main.py, src/launchers/launcher_orchestrator.py
- **Started:** 2026-09-10
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-11 (`35c69c2894`)
- **Summary:** Bounded, timestamped startup phases with a StartupSession watchdog; optional Tools/Rate provider degrades the shell instead of stalling the splash; Retry / Continue / Copy diagnostics / Close dialog replaces quit-on-error.
- **Evidence:** Deterministic tests inject successful, missing, exception-raising and never-completing providers and prove bounded splash lifetime, degraded shell startup, stale-generation isolation and deleted-widget guards.
