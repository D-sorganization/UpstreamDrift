# Development Log — UpstreamDrift

State table for every feature in flight in this repository. Update entries
**in place**; never append dated sections. One entry per feature, from proposal
to ship. See the `development-logs` section of `AGENTS.md` for the binding rules
and `shared_scripts/development_log.py` for the validator.

- **Portfolio:** `golf`
- **WIP limit:** `4`
- **Last audited:** `2026-09-08` by `claude`

## States

`proposed` → `in_progress` → `in_review` → `shipped`, with `parked` reachable
from any live state and `abandoned` from `parked`. `shipped` never returns to
`in_progress`; open a new entry instead.

### DL-#9533 · Test-only extras reachable from the dev lock

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** `#9533`
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9533-test-extras`
- **PR:** not created
- **Paths:** `pyproject.toml`, `.github/workflows/lock-refresh.yml`, `requirements*.lock`, `environment.yml`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`SELF`)
- **Summary:** `openpyxl` and `imageio` were declared only in the `gui-tools` and `pose` extras, so the dev-compiled `requirements-dev.lock` never installed them and ~24 CI tests failed on import. Both now resolve through the `dev` extra; lock regeneration is delegated to a dispatch-only `lock-refresh.yml` workflow that runs `make sync-deps` on ubuntu + Python 3.12 and opens a PR, since Windows/WSL cannot regenerate correctly (#9533).
- **Next step:** Dispatch `.github/workflows/lock-refresh.yml` from `main` once this PR merges, then confirm the `ci-standard.yml` dependency-consistency freshness gate and the 24 previously failing tests go green.
