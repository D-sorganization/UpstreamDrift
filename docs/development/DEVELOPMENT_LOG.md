### DL-#9762 · `bioptim` Optimal-Control Backend and the Swing-Dynamics Fixes

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9762 (epic); prerequisites #9755, #9756, #9757, #9758, #9759, #9760, #9761
- **Branch:** `claude/fixes-epic-implementation-x2bu36`
- **PR:** [#9768](https://github.com/D-sorganization/UpstreamDrift/pull/9768) (open)
- **Paths:** `src/shared/python/optimization/ocp/`,
  `src/shared/python/optimization/casadi_backend.py`,
  `src/shared/python/optimization/model_provider.py`,
  `src/shared/python/optimization/backend_registry.py`,
  `src/shared/python/motion_pipeline/model_bridge.py`,
  `src/shared/python/estimation/`, `benchmarks/bioptim_parity.py`,
  `docs/adr/0050-optimizer-backend-registry-and-bioptim.md`,
  `docs/estimation/bioptim_parity.md`, `docs/issues/EPIC_BIOPTIM_OCP_INTEGRATION.md`,
  `.github/workflows/ci-optional-stack.yml`, `scripts/config/architecture_budget.json`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`SELF`)
- **Summary:** Adopts `pyomeca/bioptim` as an opt-in optimal-control layer
  driven by UpstreamDrift's own CasADi dynamics through bioptim's custom-model
  protocol (no biorbd, no conda), and fixes the defects that made the existing
  dynamic backends unphysical. The URDF bridge and model provider now emit
  anthropometric link inertials so torque limits mean something (#9755); the
  CasADi backend gains mass-matrix, forward-dynamics and RK4 kernels, a
  `dynamics_defect` diagnostic and a real multiple-shooting transcription, and
  its finite-difference path is deprecated (#9756); the MAP estimators count and
  can refuse non-finite residuals (#9757) and gate free parameters on
  identifiability (#9758); the optional-stack lane gained CasADi, Crocoddyl and
  bioptim legs (#9759); `backend_registry` plus ADR-0050 assign each of six
  backends a problem class (#9760). Phases 0-3 of the epic are implemented and
  tested: compat shims, `SymbolicSwingModel` validated against Pinocchio,
  `SwingBioModel`, the clubhead-speed OCP with a parity benchmark, and the
  keypoint-tracking OCP. Two structural findings are recorded rather than
  hidden: maximising terminal speed is concave and does not converge in any
  backend once the dynamics are enforced (so the OCP defaults to a convex
  target-speed objective), and the six-marker set cannot observe the full
  seven-DOF chain (hip and trunk rotation are an exact null direction), so every
  tracking solve reports what it could not see.
- **Next step:** Confirm the `tests` lanes on PR #9768, then open the phase-4
  parameter-block entry.


### DL-#9533 · Test-Only Extras Reachable From the Dev Lock

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **PR:** #9716 (open; `Fixes #9533`)
- **Paths:** `pyproject.toml`, `.github/workflows/lock-refresh.yml`,
  `requirements*.lock`, `environment.yml`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`SELF`)
- **Summary:** `openpyxl` and `imageio` were declared only in the `gui-tools`
  and `pose` extras, so the dev-compiled `requirements-dev.lock` never installed
  them and ~24 CI tests failed on import. Both now resolve through the `dev`
  extra; lock regeneration is delegated to a dispatch-only `lock-refresh.yml`
  workflow that runs `make sync-deps` on ubuntu + Python 3.12 and opens a PR,
  since Windows/WSL cannot regenerate correctly (#9533).
- **Next step:** Land the regenerated locks. PR #9768 carries them already
  (regenerated with `make sync-deps` on Python 3.12, the exact interpreter
  the `dependency-consistency` gate uses), because that gate is red on
  `main` and blocks every open PR until the locks catch up; `lock-refresh.yml`
  stays the standing mechanism for the next drift.

### DL-#9249 · UI: Pin @vitejs/Plugin-React to ^5 Until Vite 8

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **PR:** #9718 (open; `Fixes #9249`)
- **Paths:** `.github/dependabot.yml`, `ui/README.md`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`7cdbb0a3d`)
- **Summary:** Dependabot ignores `@vitejs/plugin-react` major updates
  because 6.x needs Vite 8 (Vite 7 exports no `./internal`); the pairing
  constraint is documented in `ui/README.md`.
- **Next step:** Merge the guard PR; revisit the paired vite@8 +
  plugin-react@6 upgrade once `vitest`/`@react-three/*` are Vite-8 ready.

### DL-#9470 · Launch-Monitor Analysis Handlers Onto the Async_Action Worker

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9470
- **PR:** #9742
- **Paths:** `src/tools/launch_monitor_analytics/gui.py`, `src/tools/launch_monitor_analytics/_embed_adapter.py`, `tests/ui/tools/launch_monitor/test_async_actions.py`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`SELF` on this branch: `tests/ui/tools/launch_monitor` + `tests/tools/test_async_action.py` all passing, PyQt6 6.11.0 offscreen)
- **Summary:** All seven analysis handlers (`treatment`, `relationship`, `multivariate`, `model`, `comparison`, `dispersion`, `trend`) now run their compute on the #8880 `async_action` worker via one shared `AsyncActionBar`; synchronous `present(compute())` paths kept; embed adapter `cleanup()` cancels and joins the worker. First slice of the #9470 tool checklist; the remaining tools are follow-ups.
- **Next step:** Merge PR #9472 (the #8880 mechanism) before this branch — it is stacked on `readiness/p2-8880-async-action-worker`.

### DL-#9387 · Unit-Gate Worker Corruption: `src`-Identity Sentinel and Leak Fixes

- **State:** shipped
- **Owner:** claude
- **PR:** #9741 (merged; `Fixes #9387`)
- **Paths:** `tests/unit/repo_hygiene/test_src_identity_sentinel.py`,
  `tests/imports/test_gui_import_boundaries.py`,
  `tests/integration/test_golf_launcher_integration.py`,
  `tests/unit/engines/pinocchio/test_tasks.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_ux_enhancements.py`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`c70d5ddae`)
- **Summary:** Static audit of `tests/` (conftests excluded) found 83
  `sys.modules['src*']` mutation sites in 23 files with 0 unambiguous
  leakers; the judgment-call leaks (ux-enhancements fixture, pinocchio
  tasks fixture, GUI import-boundary drops, golf-launcher pops) are now
  explicitly snapshot/restored, and a runtime sentinel runs each of the
  four documented victim files in a serial subprocess asserting
  `sys.modules['src']` identity and the `src.*` namespace are unchanged.
- **Next step:** Watch this PR's `quality-gate` run once after opening;
  on green, protected squash merge closes #9387, then rerun the flaky
  `unit-test-gate` histories of #9384/#9374/#9404 to confirm no fresh
  worker-corruption victims appear.

### DL-#9494 · Resolve the CLAUDE.md `--no-verify` Contradiction by Fixing the Windows Hook Environment

- **State:** shipped
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9494
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9494-precommit-env`
- **PR:** #9744
- **Paths:** `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `SPEC.md`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`dbc6727aa`)
- **Summary:** CLAUDE.md forbade `git commit --no-verify` while agents on
  Windows reported every pre-commit invocation failing (hook virtualenvs
  targeting Python 3.11, absent from the workstation). Investigation found no
  interpreter pin left in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`default_language_version:
python: python`, 3.11 pin removed by #1792/#2720), and on Python 3.13.3 every
  commit-stage hook plus pre-push `mypy`/`bandit` passes after a from-scratch
  environment build. Option (a) of the issue is therefore satisfied; CLAUDE.md
  now documents the resolved environment and states that the `--no-verify`
  prohibition stands on Windows with no blanket exception.
- **Next step:** Record CI on PR #9744; on merge, confirm the protected-main
  sync lands the resolved hook environment note.

### DL-#9733 · Fail Fast on the Uninitialized Vendored Tools Fallback

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9733
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9733-fail-fast`
- **PR:** #9743 (open; `Fixes #9733`)
- **Paths:** `src/__init__.py`, `tests/unit/repo_hygiene/test_src_fallback_fail_fast_9733.py`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`160f9b759`)
- **Summary:** When `vendor/ud-tools` is uninitialized, `src/__init__.py`'s
  fallback registration mistook UpstreamDrift's own aliased `shared.python` copy
  for an installed Tools distribution, installed `_VendoredToolsFallbackFinder`,
  and livelocked pytest collection in meta-path `find_spec` recursion. The
  registration probe now raises an actionable ImportError naming the remediation
  command before any finder is installed; the initialized path is unchanged.
- **Next step:** Record CI on PR #9743; on green, protected squash merge
  closes #9733.
