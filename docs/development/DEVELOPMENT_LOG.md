# Development Log — UpstreamDrift

State table for every feature in flight in this repository. Update entries
**in place**; never append dated sections. One entry per feature, from proposal
to ship. See the `development-logs` section of `AGENTS.md` for the binding rules
and `shared_scripts/development_log.py` for the validator.

## States

`proposed` → `in_progress` → `in_review` → `shipped`, with `parked` reachable
from any live state and `abandoned` from `parked`. `shipped` never returns to
`in_progress`; open a new entry instead.

### DL-#9494 · Resolve the CLAUDE.md `--no-verify` Contradiction by Fixing the Windows Hook Environment

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9494
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9494-precommit-env`
- **PR:** #9744
- **Paths:** `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `SPEC.md`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`dbc6727aa`)
- **Summary:** CLAUDE.md forbade `git commit --no-verify` while agents on
  Windows reported every pre-commit invocation failing (hook virtualenvs
  targeting Python 3.11, absent from the workstation). Investigation found no
  interpreter pin left in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`default_language_version:
python: python`, 3.11 pin removed by #1792/#2720), and on Python 3.13.3 every
  commit-stage hook plus pre-push `mypy`/`bandit` passes after a from-scratch
  environment build. Option (a) of the issue is therefore satisfied; CLAUDE.md
  now documents the resolved environment and states that the `--no-verify`
  prohibition stands on Windows with no blanket exception.
- **Next step:** Record CI on PR #9744; on merge, confirm the protected-main
  sync lands the resolved hook environment note.
