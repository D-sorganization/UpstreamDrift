### DL-#9409 · Always-on quality gate lane and conftest src-pivot guard

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** `claude`
- **Issue:** [#9409](https://github.com/D-sorganization/UpstreamDrift/issues/9409)
- **PR:** opened from `claude/issue-9409-always-on-gate` immediately after the `SELF` commit (body starts `Fixes #9409`)
- **Paths:** `.github/workflows/ci-standard.yml`, `tests/unit/repo_hygiene/test_no_conftest_src_module_pivot.py`, `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_TRACKING.md`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`SELF`)
- **Summary:** CI Standard gains an always-on, ≤10-minute `always-on-unit-lane` (verify_installation import smoke over the shared Tools alias roots, top-level smoke tests, contract tests) that `quality-gate` requires `success` on every PR including docs-only ones; a repo-hygiene guard forbids any conftest from pivoting `sys.modules["src"]` directly (must use `EngineSrcPivot`). Deferred on #9409: main-branch cancel exemption (RM campaign) and nightly cross-engine dedupe (#8725/#9002).
- **Next step:** Verify the first CI run of the PR executes `always-on-unit-lane` to `success` within its 10-minute budget.

### DL-#9533 · Test-Only Extras Reachable From the Dev Lock

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **PR:** #9716 (open; `Fixes #9533`)
- **Paths:** `pyproject.toml`, `.github/workflows/lock-refresh.yml`,
  `requirements*.lock`, `environment.yml`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`289b3aac2`)
- **Summary:** `openpyxl` and `imageio` were declared only in the `gui-tools`
  and `pose` extras, so the dev-compiled `requirements-dev.lock` never installed
  them and ~24 CI tests failed on import. Both now resolve through the `dev`
  extra; lock regeneration is delegated to a dispatch-only `lock-refresh.yml`
  workflow that runs `make sync-deps` on ubuntu + Python 3.12 and opens a PR,
  since Windows/WSL cannot regenerate correctly (#9533).
- **Next step:** Regenerate the locks via `lock-refresh.yml` so the
  dependency-consistency freshness gate and the 24 previously failing tests
  go green.

### DL-#9249 · UI: Pin @vitejs/Plugin-React to ^5 Until Vite 8

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **PR:** #9718 (open; `Fixes #9249`)
- **Paths:** `.github/dependabot.yml`, `ui/README.md`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`7cdbb0a3d`)
- **Summary:** Dependabot ignores `@vitejs/plugin-react` major updates
  because 6.x needs Vite 8 (Vite 7 exports no `./internal`); the pairing
  constraint is documented in `ui/README.md`.
- **Next step:** Merge the guard PR; revisit the paired vite@8 +
  plugin-react@6 upgrade once `vitest`/`@react-three/*` are Vite-8 ready.

### DL-#9470 · Launch-Monitor Analysis Handlers Onto the Async_Action Worker

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9470
- **PR:** #9742
- **Paths:** `src/tools/launch_monitor_analytics/gui.py`, `src/tools/launch_monitor_analytics/_embed_adapter.py`, `tests/ui/tools/launch_monitor/test_async_actions.py`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`SELF` on this branch: `tests/ui/tools/launch_monitor` + `tests/tools/test_async_action.py` all passing, PyQt6 6.11.0 offscreen)
- **Summary:** All seven analysis handlers (`treatment`, `relationship`, `multivariate`, `model`, `comparison`, `dispersion`, `trend`) now run their compute on the #8880 `async_action` worker via one shared `AsyncActionBar`; synchronous `present(compute())` paths kept; embed adapter `cleanup()` cancels and joins the worker. First slice of the #9470 tool checklist; the remaining tools are follow-ups.
- **Next step:** Merge PR #9472 (the #8880 mechanism) before this branch — it is stacked on `readiness/p2-8880-async-action-worker`.

### DL-#9387 · Unit-Gate Worker Corruption: `src`-Identity Sentinel and Leak Fixes

- **State:** shipped
- **Owner:** claude
- **PR:** #9741 (merged; `Fixes #9387`)
- **Paths:** `tests/unit/repo_hygiene/test_src_identity_sentinel.py`,
  `tests/imports/test_gui_import_boundaries.py`,
  `tests/integration/test_golf_launcher_integration.py`,
  `tests/unit/engines/pinocchio/test_tasks.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_ux_enhancements.py`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`c70d5ddae`)
- **Summary:** Static audit of `tests/` (conftests excluded) found 83
  `sys.modules['src*']` mutation sites in 23 files with 0 unambiguous
  leakers; the judgment-call leaks (ux-enhancements fixture, pinocchio
  tasks fixture, GUI import-boundary drops, golf-launcher pops) are now
  explicitly snapshot/restored, and a runtime sentinel runs each of the
  four documented victim files in a serial subprocess asserting
  `sys.modules['src']` identity and the `src.*` namespace are unchanged.
- **Next step:** Watch this PR's `quality-gate` run once after opening;
  on green, protected squash merge closes #9387, then rerun the flaky
  `unit-test-gate` histories of #9384/#9374/#9404 to confirm no fresh
  worker-corruption victims appear.

### DL-#9494 · Resolve the CLAUDE.md `--no-verify` Contradiction by Fixing the Windows Hook Environment

- **State:** shipped
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9494
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9494-precommit-env`
- **PR:** #9744
- **Paths:** `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `SPEC.md`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`dbc6727aa`)
- **Summary:** CLAUDE.md forbade `git commit --no-verify` while agents on
  Windows reported every pre-commit invocation failing (hook virtualenvs
  targeting Python 3.11, absent from the workstation). Investigation found no
  interpreter pin left in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`default_language_version:
python: python`, 3.11 pin removed by #1792/#2720), and on Python 3.13.3 every
  commit-stage hook plus pre-push `mypy`/`bandit` passes after a from-scratch
  environment build. Option (a) of the issue is therefore satisfied; CLAUDE.md
  now documents the resolved environment and states that the `--no-verify`
  prohibition stands on Windows with no blanket exception.
- **Next step:** Record CI on PR #9744; on merge, confirm the protected-main
  sync lands the resolved hook environment note.

### DL-#9733 · Fail Fast on the Uninitialized Vendored Tools Fallback

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9733
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9733-fail-fast`
- **PR:** #9743 (open; `Fixes #9733`)
- **Paths:** `src/__init__.py`, `tests/unit/repo_hygiene/test_src_fallback_fail_fast_9733.py`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`160f9b759`)
- **Summary:** When `vendor/ud-tools` is uninitialized, `src/__init__.py`'s
  fallback registration mistook UpstreamDrift's own aliased `shared.python` copy
  for an installed Tools distribution, installed `_VendoredToolsFallbackFinder`,
  and livelocked pytest collection in meta-path `find_spec` recursion. The
  registration probe now raises an actionable ImportError naming the remediation
  command before any finder is installed; the initialized path is unchanged.
- **Next step:** Record CI on PR #9743; on green, protected squash merge
  closes #9733.
