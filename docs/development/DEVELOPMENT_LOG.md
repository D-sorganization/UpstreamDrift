# Development Log — UpstreamDrift

State table for every feature in flight in this repository. Update entries
**in place**; never append dated sections. One entry per feature, from proposal
to ship. See the `development-logs` section of `AGENTS.md` for the binding rules
and `shared_scripts/development_log.py` for the validator.

## States

`proposed` → `in_progress` → `in_review` → `shipped`, with `parked` reachable
from any live state and `abandoned` from `parked`. `shipped` never returns to
`in_progress`; open a new entry instead.
