# Development Log — UpstreamDrift

State table for every feature in flight in this repository. Update entries
**in place**; never append dated sections. One entry per feature, from proposal
to ship. See the `development-logs` section of `AGENTS.md` for the binding rules
and `shared_scripts/development_log.py` for the validator.

- **Portfolio:** golf
- **WIP limit:** 8

## States

`proposed` → `in_progress` → `in_review` → `shipped`, with `parked` reachable
from any live state and `abandoned` from `parked`. `shipped` never returns to
`in_progress`; open a new entry instead.

### DL-#9542 · Bunker Exit State Consistency, Provenance, and Result Envelope

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9542
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9542-exit-envelope`
- **PR:** #9728 (open)
- **Paths:** `src/bunkershot3d/ball/**`
- **Started:** 2026-09-07
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-07 (`SELF`)
- **Summary:** `SandDelivery` now refuses contradictory exit speed/vector pairs and owns copies of list-supplied exit vectors so post-construction mutation cannot invalidate the frozen record; the `to_post_impact_state` boundary carries explicit `ExitVectorProvenance` labels, and `PostImpactEnvelope` wraps the flight handoff with the validity verdict, F0 tier, per-group frames, the proper `HEAD_FRAME_TO_FLIGHT_TRANSFORM`, a schema version, and a SHA-256 source digest with JSON round trip. Reflection rejection itself was already delivered by PR #9574 and is not redone.
- **Next step:** Open the protected PR to `main` with `Fixes #9542`, label `agent:claude`, and RED/GREEN evidence in the body.

### DL-#9494 · Resolve the CLAUDE.md `--no-verify` Contradiction by Fixing the Windows Hook Environment

- **State:** in_review
- **Owner:** claude
- **Issue:** #9494
- **Branch:** `claude/issue-9494-precommit-env`
- **PR:** #9744
- **Paths:** `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `SPEC.md`
- **Started:** 2026-09-08
- **Last verified:** 2026-09-08 (`dbc6727aa`)
- **Summary:** CLAUDE.md forbade `git commit --no-verify` while agents on
  Windows reported every pre-commit invocation failing (hook virtualenvs
  targeting Python 3.11, absent from the workstation). Investigation found no
  interpreter pin left in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`default_language_version:
python: python`, 3.11 pin removed by #1792/#2720), and on Python 3.13.3 every
  commit-stage hook plus pre-push `mypy`/`bandit` passes after a from-scratch
  environment build. Option (a) of the issue is therefore satisfied; CLAUDE.md
  now documents the resolved environment and states that the `--no-verify`
  prohibition stands on Windows with no blanket exception.
- **Next step:** Record CI on PR #9744; on merge, confirm the protected-main
  sync lands the resolved hook environment note.
