# Native Port Implementation Checkpoint

## Scope and Verified Results

The preceding review was progress: it corrected the completed 0.80 s result and
identified concrete engine discrepancies. The full matching goal remains active.
This checkpoint adds native infrastructure, not a completed golfer port.

- ControlTower: isolated Python 3.12.3 environment at
  `/home/dieterolson/simscape-pinocchio-9967/.venv` in WSL `ControlTower-Runner`.
  Pinocchio 4.1.0 imports successfully. Dependency versions are recorded in
  `pinocchio_controltower_20260911_requirements.txt`.
- Native Pinocchio test: `test_native_constraint_dynamics.py` passed (1 test,
  0.79 s). It applies six independent forces/moments to a free body and verifies
  zero acceleration under a rigid world closure versus nonzero unconstrained
  acceleration. This is a capability test, not golfer topology or rollout parity.
- Pinocchio 4.1 requires `initConstraintDynamics(model, data, models, datas)`.
  The three-argument invocation failed in the installed native library; retain
  this evidence when adapting earlier examples or supporting other releases.
- R2025b native exporter test passed on DeskComputer. TDD began with an actual
  missing-function failure, then found serialization errors during development.
  The exporter records original expressions, resolved numeric values, units as
  separate parameter entries, block paths, source libraries, comment state and
  port connectivity. No unresolved parameter is substituted with a physical
  default. It does not compile variants or certify active topology.

## New Files and Commands

MATLAB source is under
`src/engines/Simscape_Multibody_Models/3D_Golf_Model/matlab/motion_matching/`:
`shared/export_native_inventory.m` and `tests/test_export_native_inventory.m`.
These deliberate source files were explicitly staged because an existing broad
`motion_matching/` gitignore pattern otherwise hides them.

Run native tests in R2025b after adding those directories:

```matlab
results = runtests('test_export_native_inventory');
assertSuccess(results);
```

Run the Pinocchio capability test in the pinned environment, using the repo's
native-test lane (`-m live_simulation`). On ControlTower the standalone transferred
test was executed with:

```text
/home/dieterolson/simscape-pinocchio-9967/.venv/bin/python -m pytest /mnt/c/Users/diete/test_native_constraint_dynamics_9967.py --confcutdir=/mnt/c/Users/diete -q
```

## Full Golf Inventory Job

Launched on DeskComputer at 21:00:29 PDT with explicit
`C:/Program Files/MATLAB/R2025b/bin/matlab.exe`. Process IDs observed:
94704 launcher and 82556 worker. Revalidate command line and creation time;
do not restart based on this document alone.

Log: `C:/Users/diete/SimscapeTour9921/native-inventory-green4.log`.
Expected result: `C:/Users/diete/SimscapeTour9921/native-inventory-20260911.json`.
It loads the existing runtime checkout model, assigns UpperArmLength and
LowerArmLength from `initial_velocity_seed_qualified_r2025b.json`, exports,
and closes without saving. The job is an uncompiled parameter inventory;
it does not replay the selected candidate's torques or dynamic state.
At this checkpoint the native test passed and the golf export remained running.

## Findings That Change the Port

1. The static SLX contains a Flexible Cylindrical Beam, but its parent Flexible
   Beam Model subsystem has `Commented=on`. Verify ancestry in the native
   inventory and compiled variant selection before treating the shaft as rigid.
2. Native `golf_kinematic_schema.json` has separate left and right forearm Rz
   coordinates, LFInput and RFInput, in addition to LEInput and REInput elbows.
   The proposed MuJoCo 19-joint internal chain omits those forearm rotations.
   Do not derive the Pinocchio port from that reduced topology without a proven
   reduction. There are 27 native effort channels, not necessarily 27 independent
   unconstrained degrees of freedom.
3. Existing shared Simscape-to-URDF conversion admits unevaluated expressions,
   skipped constraints and approximations. Its helpers also have Tools ownership
   notices. Reuse compatible infrastructure but do not edit mirrored files or
   silently accept approximations as a native physical export.

## Next Execution Steps

1. Poll the exact inventory job, collect its terminal exit and hash the export.
   Inspect numeric resolution failures for physical parameters and resolve them
   from the actual candidate workspace; distinguish enum strings from failures.
2. Reconstruct physical frame connectivity through subsystem ports and fixed
   transforms. Exclude commented ancestors and qualify variant activity natively.
   Export masses/COM/inertias and joint transforms in explicit SI units.
3. Preserve the two forearm joints, both grip frames and all base efforts in the
   canonical representation. Use a tree plus engine-level closure constraints,
   preserving virtual work under coordinate changes.
4. Build the Pinocchio model and perform same-pose FK against the existing native
   body-frame exports before force-pulse or full-rollout parity tests.
5. Keep all-source and candidate identities separate from this capability probe.
   Only a full continuous native rollout can qualify the final swing.
