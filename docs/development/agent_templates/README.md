## Using Agent Templates

### For AI Assistants

When using these templates:
1. Select the agent most appropriate for the task
2. Review the agent's expertise and guidelines
3. Follow the specified workflow and constraints
4. Apply the agent's perspective to the problem

### For Human Developers

Agent templates can guide:
- Code review approach
- Problem-solving perspective
- Documentation style
- Quality standards

### Template Structure

Each agent template typically includes:

1. **Role Definition**
   - Primary expertise
   - Focus areas
   - Perspective

2. **Guidelines**
   - Operating principles
   - Quality standards
   - Constraints

3. **Workflow**
   - Typical process
   - Steps to follow
   - Decision criteria

4. **Examples**
   - Sample outputs
   - Common scenarios
   - Best practices

## Creating New Agents

To create a new specialized agent:

1. **Define the need**: Identify a specific, recurring development task
2. **Specify expertise**: Determine required knowledge and skills
3. **Establish guidelines**: Define operating principles and constraints
4. **Create workflow**: Outline the typical process
5. **Add examples**: Provide concrete illustrations
6. **Test and refine**: Use the agent template and improve based on results

## Agent Combinations

For complex tasks, combine multiple agents:

- **Research + Implementation**: curie → pragmatist
- **Feature + Review**: feature_finder → critic
- **Design + Documentation**: layout_specialist → bibliographer
- **Security + Quality**: sentinel → coherency_expert

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection
- Choose the agent that best matches the task's primary objective
- Consider the development phase (research, implementation, review)
- Match agent expertise to problem domain

### Agent Usage
- Stay in character with the agent's perspective
- Follow the agent's guidelines consistently
- Apply the agent's quality standards
- Use the agent's typical workflow

### Agent Evolution
- Update templates based on experience
- Refine guidelines as project evolves
- Add new examples and scenarios
- Remove outdated practices
