title: Spring-Damper Impact Model Generates Zero Spin
labels: physics-error, critical
---

# Issue Description
The `SpringDamperImpactModel` (Kelvin-Voigt) calculates contact forces purely along the surface normal, ignoring tangential friction forces. Consequently, it generates zero spin for all impacts, regardless of loft or attack angle.

**File:** `src/shared/python/impact_model.py`
**Line:** ~280-300 (SpringDamperImpactModel.solve)

# Expected Physics
Spin is generated by the tangential component of the contact force (friction) and the offset of the force vector from the ball's center of gravity. For a lofted club, the sliding velocity between face and ball creates a significant friction force that applies torque to the ball.

# Actual Implementation
The loop calculates `f_contact` as:
```python
f_contact = f_magnitude * n
```
It updates linear velocity but leaves angular velocity untouched:
```python
ball_angular_velocity=pre_state.ball_angular_velocity.copy()
```

# Impact
- **Accuracy:** The model produces "knuckleballs" (zero spin) for all shots.
- **Usability:** The `SpringDamperImpactModel` is practically unusable for golf simulation until this is fixed, as spin is the primary determinant of trajectory.

# Recommended Fix
1. Calculate the tangential relative velocity `v_tangent` at the contact point.
2. Calculate friction force `f_friction = -mu * f_normal * direction(v_tangent)` (or a compliant friction model).
3. Apply `f_friction` to the ball's linear momentum.
4. Apply torque `tau = radius x f_friction` to the ball's angular momentum.
