# Assessment: Documentation (Category B)

## Grade: 9/10

## Analysis
The documentation quality in this repository is exceptional.
- **Docstring Coverage**: 97.24% of functions and methods have docstrings. This is well above industry standards.
- **Quality**: Sampled docstrings (e.g., in `PhysicsEngine` protocol) are detailed, explaining parameters, return values, and physics concepts clearly.
- **Project Documentation**: The repository contains extensive markdown documentation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CURRENT_STATE_SUMMARY.md`), providing high-level context and architectural guidance.

## Recommendations
1. **Maintain Excellence**: Continue enforcing docstring requirements in CI.
2. **API Docs**: Ensure that the high quality of docstrings is leveraged to generate user-facing API documentation (e.g., via Sphinx or MkDocs), which appears to be configured in `pyproject.toml`.
