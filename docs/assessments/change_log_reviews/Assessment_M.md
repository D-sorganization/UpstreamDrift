# Assessment M: Educational Resources & Tutorials

## Grade: 7/10

## Focus
Learning curve, examples, video guides.

## Findings
*   **Strengths:**
    *   `launchers/` act as runnable examples.
    *   The project aims to be an educational platform for biomechanics.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of "Step-by-Step" tutorial for a user's first swing analysis.
    *   No video guides found (though not expected in a repo, links would be good).

## Recommendations
1.  Add a `tutorials/` folder with Jupyter notebooks showing how to use `GenericPhysicsRecorder` programmatically.
