# Completist Audit Report - 2025-01-22

**Auditor:** Completist Agent (Jules)
**Date:** 2025-01-22
**Scope:** Incomplete Implementations, Stubs, TODOs, and Placeholders.

## 1. Executive Summary

A comprehensive audit of the codebase was conducted to identify incomplete or placeholder implementations. The audit revealed **2 Critical** issues blocking core functionality, **4 Feature Gaps**, and several instances of Technical Debt.

| Category | Count | Status |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Critical Incomplete** | 2 | 🔴 Action Required |
| **Feature Gaps** | 4 | 🟡 To Prioritize |
| **Technical Debt** | 2 | 🔵 Monitor |
| **Documentation Gaps** | 2 | ⚪ Low Priority |

**Key Findings:**
*   The **OpenSim** physics engine GUI (`opensim_gui.py`) lacks a functional simulation loop implementation, displaying a "Not Implemented" warning to users.
*   The **MuJoCo** "Live Analysis" configuration (`RemoteRecorder.set_analysis_config`) is disconnected, meaning live UI adjustments do not propagate to the simulation.
*   Several "stub" functions identified in initial scans (e.g., flight models) were verified to be correct abstract base class definitions or proper delegations, and are **not** issues.

## 2. Critical Incomplete (Blocking Features)

These items block core functionality expected by the user.

### 1. OpenSim Simulation Logic Missing
*   **Location:** `engines/physics_engines/opensim/python/opensim_gui.py`
*   **Method:** `OpenSimGolfGUI.run_simulation` calls `self.model.run_simulation()`
*   **Issue:** The method catches `NotImplementedError` and displays "OpenSim simulation is not yet fully implemented". This indicates the backend `opensim_golf.core` or the GUI integration is unfinished.
*   **Impact:** **High (5/5)**. Users cannot run OpenSim simulations via the GUI, rendering the "OpenSim Golf Interface" largely non-functional for simulation tasks.
*   **Action:** Created Issue `ISSUE_OPEN_SIM_INCOMPLETE`.

### 2. MuJoCo Live Analysis Configuration Disconnect
*   **Location:** `engines/physics_engines/mujoco/python/humanoid_launcher.py`
*   **Method:** `RemoteRecorder.set_analysis_config`
*   **Issue:** The method is a `pass` with comment "Config driven by simulation loop". However, `LivePlotWidget` calls this method to update analysis settings from the UI. Since `RemoteRecorder` does not forward this to the remote simulation process, UI controls for live analysis have no effect.
*   **Impact:** **Medium-High (4/5)**. Features implying live control of analysis metrics are broken/misleading.
*   **Action:** Created Issue `ISSUE_MUJOCO_CONFIG_DISCONNECT`.

## 3. Feature Gap Matrix

Items indicated by TODOs or partial implementations.

| Module | Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CI / Workflows** | HTML Dashboard | Missing | `nightly-cross-engine.yml`: "TODO: Generate HTML dashboard showing..." |
| **URDF Generator** | 3D Visualization | Fallback | `visualization_widget.py` uses 2.5D QPainter fallback. Full 3D OpenGL is unimplemented in this widget. |
| **OpenSim Models** | File consistency | Incomplete | `CMakeLists.txt`: TODOs regarding inconsistent filenames and file inclusion. |
| **Tutorials** | Student Exercises | Intentionally Empty | C++ files contain "TODO: Add Code" for educational purposes. |

---

## 4. Technical Debt Register

*   **CSS Hack:** `shared/models/opensim/opensim-models/Tutorials/doc/styles/site.css` contains `/* HACK: Temporary fix for CONF-15412 */`.
*   **Magic Number Bypass:** `tools/urdf_generator/mujoco_viewer.py` uses `9.810` to bypass quality checks. (Memory)

---

## 5. Documentation Gaps

*   **Advanced Analysis:** `shared/python/dashboard/advanced_analysis.py` method `update_plot` lacks documentation.
*   **Flight Models:** Abstract base properties in `shared/python/flight_models.py` flagged, but concrete implementations are documented.

---

## 6. Recommended Implementation Order

1.  **Fix MuJoCo Config Propagation:** Establish a communication channel (e.g., ZMQ command socket) to send `set_analysis_config` updates from `RemoteRecorder` (GUI) to `ProcessWorker` (Simulation).
2.  **Implement OpenSim Simulation:** Flesh out the `run_simulation` method in `opensim_golf.core` or disable the "Run" button with a "Coming Soon" label if not ready.
3.  **CI Dashboard:** Implement the HTML summary generation in the nightly workflow to improve visibility of cross-engine test results.
