# Assessment M: Educational Resources & Tutorials

## Grade: 7/10

## Focus
Learning curve, examples, video guides.

## Findings
*   **Strengths:**
    *   The User Guide in `docs/user_guide/` is comprehensive.
    *   Launchers include tooltips and status checks to guide the user.
    *   The `UnifiedLauncher` simplifies the initial experience.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   There is a lack of interactive tutorials (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks) that would allow users to experiment with the API incrementally.
    *   Video guides (referenced as a target in the README/Assessment prompt) are not present in the repository.

## Recommendations
1.  Create a `tutorials/` directory with Jupyter notebooks covering:
    *   Basic API usage.
    *   Loading and visualizing a model.
    *   Running a simple simulation.
2.  Consider recording short screencasts and linking them in the README.
