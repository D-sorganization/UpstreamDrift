# Assessment I: Code Style

## Grade: 10/10

## Summary
Code style is rigorously enforced through automated tools, resulting in a highly consistent and readable codebase.

## Strengths
- **Tooling**: `ruff` and `black` are configured in `pyproject.toml` and used in pre-commit hooks.
- **Type Hinting**: Strong usage of `mypy` with strict settings (`disallow_untyped_defs`, `warn_return_any`).
- **Modern Python**: Usage of `from __future__ import annotations` and Python 3.11+ features.
- **Docstring Standards**: Consistent Google-style docstrings.

## Weaknesses
- None identified.

## Recommendations
- Maintain the high standard.
