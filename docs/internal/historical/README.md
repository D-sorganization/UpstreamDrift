## Archive Policy

Documents are moved to this directory when:
1. They describe completed development phases
2. The information is primarily of historical interest
3. They have been superseded by newer documentation
4. They remain valuable for understanding project evolution

Active development documentation remains in other directories (plans, assessments, development).
