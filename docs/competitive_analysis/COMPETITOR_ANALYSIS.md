## Market Positioning

### Our Advantages
- **Open source / transparency:** Inspectable physics vs. black-box commercial algorithms.
- **Multi-engine integration:** Compare results across MuJoCo, Drake, and OpenSim.
- **Scientific rigor:** Direct validation against OpenSim biomechanical models.
- **Cost (free):** Accessible to students, researchers, and developers.
- **Customizability:** Extendable for novel research (e.g., custom robots, non-standard clubs).

### Our Gaps
- **No hardware:** We rely on imported data; we cannot generate initial measurement "truth".
- **Less polished UI:** Developer-focused interface vs. consumer-grade commercial UX.
- **Smaller community:** Niche research community vs. massive user bases of GSPro/TrackMan.
- **Less validation data:** Lack of massive shot databases for tuning.
